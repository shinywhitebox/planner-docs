{%section "People" %}

Creating a roster is all about *people*. So, how do you manage people in {{app.name}}?

*People*, like *roles* are global. They are accessible from *Menu | People*. 

{%tip "Add everyone you want to manage" "People can only be added to plans if they are in global data, so make sure to add people here first" %}

#### Managing people

To add a person, click the + button on the top right. Each person needs:

- A name
- Email address
- Phone number (optional)

A persons default availability (when they can be placed into a roster/schedule) is 'anytime'. This can be modified now or later. See  {% link "availability" "concepts/availability" %}.
