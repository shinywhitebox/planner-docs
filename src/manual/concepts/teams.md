{%section "Teams" %}

Teams provide an alternative to the normal "free" layout flow. 

When Teams is enabled; as many teams are are defined are laid out in order (repeating one after the other). The same people are always in each team.

This can work in conjunction with a standard "free" layout. Teams are always put into the plan first; and any gaps left are fill in, using the standard scheduling rules. 


# TODO
- more detail on setup
