{%section "Publishing" %}

To do this, go to the plan you want to publish, and click on where it says "publication mode":
{%image "Click on 'Publication Mode'" "/assets/images/publishing/publishing-a-plan.jpg" %}

Once there; you'll be told that this places the plan into a read-only state. Click OK.
You're done!  Publishing really just changes the plan to become read only.  It doens't do anything else.
