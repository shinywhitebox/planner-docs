# Roadmap

This is a very rough guide of current intended work. Don't think what's in here is set in stone though. I very much want for the future development to be based on actual user need, so if the app isn't doing something you think it should, <a href="mailto:support@shinywhitebox.com?subject=I've an idea for the scheduler app!&body=Hi!  I've got an idea for the app: .... ">get in touch</a>.  

## Next planned work

1. Management of Exceptions (people being unavailable short term; swapping people)
1. Per plan availability / unavailability
1. Reworking Desktop UI to be less "mobile" like


## Content TODO

- Demo: Showing you around my own plan    
- Howto: Inviting others to the Organization (so they can manage their own unavailability, preferences)
