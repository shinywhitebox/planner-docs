# Roadmap

This is a very rough guide of current intended work. Don't think what's in here is set in stone though. I very much want for the future development to be based on actual user need, so if the app isn't doing something you think it should, <a href="mailto:support@shinywhitebox.com?subject=I've an idea for the scheduler app!&body=Hi!  I've got an idea for the app: .... ">get in touch</a>.  

## Next planned work

1. Management of Exceptions (people being unavailable short term; swapping people)

The above is a big task in my mind: it combines not only the ability to do such a thing; but a nice UI to wrap it all, meaning I'm going to rewrite the "share full" page. 


## Future

In no particular order...

- Settings page, including settings for:
    - Per plan availability / unavailability
    - Reworking Desktop UI to be less "mobile" like
- Automatically deleting irrelevant unavailability dates
- Date formatting options
- Name display options (first/last, last first)
- Better onboarding experience
- Link to docs from inside the app
- Better invite method


## Content TODO

- Demo: Showing you around my own plan    
- Howto: Inviting others to the Organization (so they can manage their own unavailability, preferences)
