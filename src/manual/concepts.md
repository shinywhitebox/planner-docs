{%section "A foundation for thinking"%}
There are a few of concepts that if you understand, will make using the app that much easier. 

At the very least; getting an understanding of what we mean when we use the term *Plan* or *Role* will get you half way there :)

### Many Plans 

The app supports having many plans, and people can be assigned into any of these plans.

The general idea is that you define a *Plan* to represent a recurring event (like a show). The plan spans some amount of time that isn't too long, say three months.  People are added to the plan in various roles, {{app.name}} does it's thing and gives you the final result.



{% warning "Note" "At present the app will happly assign people to multiple plans. This means it is possible to try to put someone on two different events at the same time (probably not what you want).<p> This will be addressed in a future update." %}
