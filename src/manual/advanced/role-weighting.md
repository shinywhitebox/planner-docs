{%section "What is role weighting?" %}

*Role Weights* allow you to influence how often a person is put into a role, for a plan.

{%tip "Multiple Roles" "Role weighting makes sense only when a person is in many roles!" %} 

When a person is assigned into role, the default weighting is **one (1)**. Assuming they are assigned two roles (with the default weight), they will be on each role about 50% of the time. If they were in three roles, they would be in each 33% of the time, and so on.

### Example

Consider a music team: lets assume Dennis is on Drums and Bass, but he's an awesome drummer and I want him on Drums more than bass. In this case I'd set his role weighting like this:

- Drums: 2
- Bass: 1 (default) 

In this way; he'll be put on drums more<sup>1</sup>.

<sup>1</sup>Of course; I checked with Dennis first before I made this change :)</sup>
