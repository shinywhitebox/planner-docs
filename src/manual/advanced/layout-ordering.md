{%section "What is layout ordering?" %}

Layout Order is a way to force sections (columns, if you like) of the plan to be laid out **before other sections**. In effect; layout order is like grouping. Roles with higher layout orders are laid out before those with lower order numbers.

Here's an example showing the layout order for our introductory demo:

{%image "Example Layout Order" "/assets/images/advanced/layout-order.jpg" %}

This shows that **all of Inspection** will be placed into the plan **before** Building / Cleaning and Inventory.

This means that you can force certain roles to be laid out in the plan, in their entirety, before other roles are even considered.

It's good when you want to make sure that a given role is totally populated before other roles are considered.
