{{app.name}} is a tool to schedule people across recurring events, e.g: voluteer band rosters, dynamic teams serving every week.

In these scenarios you have a number of people, able to do perform one or more roles, and you need a way to come up with a roster / schedule / plan for those people for, say, three months.

{{app.name}}, in a nutshell, will let you put those people into various roles, defines rules, vacataion times and so forth and come up with a fair plan out the other end. In short it takes all the pain away from creating rosters in google sheets / excel.
