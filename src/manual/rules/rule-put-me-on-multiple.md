{%section "Rule: Put me on Multiple..." %}

#### Overview

This rule is used when you want to put a persons name into other roles when they are assigned a certain role.

A good example is if I am leading a band; I am also playing the keyboard.  In this case I would add a rule along these lines:

- If I am assigned role "leading" also put me on role "keyboard"
