{%section "Rule: I'd like to be on with..." %}

#### Overview

This rule is used when you want to try to be scheduled on with someone else. 

Example: if I am playing the saxophone in a band; I would like to be playing with my wife (on keys) if possible.

The rule has a couple of parameters:
- **Only if they are within**: This limits *when* the rule might fire. If the person you want to be on with is scheduled on some other date that is within this range; then the rule will fire.
- **Up to**: Limits the number of times the rule can fire for this plan.  The idea is that you might want to allow someone to be shifted in your schedule (so that they are on with someone else) but only a limited number of times. i.e: fairness to others.
