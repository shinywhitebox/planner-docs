TODO: describe what it can do well/where it needs help/where to consider doing things manually.

- Does not consider people being on multiple plans
- Avail / Unavail is global to the person (can't have per plan avail/unavail)
- No editing after publishing
    - Cannot put in "exceptions"
    - Cannot swap people
- Build for mobile first, "desktop" web UI needs some love.
