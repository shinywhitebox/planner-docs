### Swipe left young man

In general, you *swipe left* to delete anything at all.  This works for:

- People
- Plans
- Roles
- Assignments in the plan (e.g: you've put someone in a role and want to delete them; just swipe the role assignment)

{%tip "Owners only" "If you cannot delete anything, it might be because you're not the owner. Only the organization owner can delete all/any data"%}
