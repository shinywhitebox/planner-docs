{%section "What is it?"%}
{{app.name}} is a tool to schedule people across recurring events, e.g: voluteer band rosters, dynamic teams serving every week.

In these scenarios you have a number of people, able to do perform one or more roles, and you need a way to come up with a roster / schedule / plan for those people for, say, three months.

{{app.name}}, in a nutshell, will let you put those people into various roles, defines rules, vacataion times and so forth and come up with a fair plan out the other end. In short it takes all the pain away from creating rosters in google sheets / excel.

{%section "How this manual is organized" %}
The manual is split into three *main* parts.

1. Installation
1. General concepts
1. Examples

While other sections exist; the above three are the main ones that'll be useful in getting you up to speed and understanding how the app works.

It's recommended that you read the Concepts guide, as this will set you up to understand how we've approached solving the problem of creating a roster. It'll also familiarise you with terms that'll be used throughout the rest of this manual.

{%section "Getting further help" %}
At present the app is in beta, and made freely available to anyone that wants to use it.

We've tried to put as much useful information into the docs such that you should only need to engage paid support if you're really stuck or want to implement a custom scenario. 

One-on-one support via our professional services.  Please get in touch with [shinywhitebox](mailto:support@shinywhitebox.com) and we can discuss your requirements and how to best help you solve them.
